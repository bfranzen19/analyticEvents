      this is a block of text designed to take up space for analytic event testing purposes. i'm going to use this space to show an example of something that irritates one of my oldest friends more than most other things that annoy him (which is basically everything. including me doing this.)

    <img src="https://a.disquscdn.com/get?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdcist.com%2Fattachments%2Fdc_tmitchell%2Fchampagneofbeers.jpg&key=qQsAqcGWdMPb2SY3XH8u2A&w=600&h=386" />
    <p>
      this picture annoys my friend beyond all else for a great many reasons. some of them are listed below:
      <ol>
        <li> this is from the opening in a bar in dc and he hates dc and all things about it </li>
        <li> it's a small high life bottle that is being treated like it is something special </li>
        <li> the tiny champagne of beers is being poured into a glass which seems like it goes against nature. </li>
        <li> the bartender's pinky is up like it's "high tea" (that's a direct quote) </li>
      </ol>
